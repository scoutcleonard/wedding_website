    "text": "In our 6 years of life here, we have come to love the East Bay and the greater Bay Area. We‚Äôll be overjoyed to have so many of our loved ones visiting for our wedding weekend. Whether you‚Äôre just looking for lodging recommendations, or planning to stay and explore beautiful California, you‚Äôll find some of our favorite recommendations below.\nThis is just a start, but we could talk about Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco, Marin, Yosemite, Tahoe, etc. etc. etc. at great length! Feel free to reach out if you want any specific recommendations; we‚Äôll be so glad to help!\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    Half Dome, Yosemite\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    Golden Gate Bridge\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    Berkeley Lab View\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    Oracle Park\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    Truckee\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    Napa Valley\n  \n\n\nWhere to Stay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gilman / Westbrae Neighborhood\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may not be a fair suggestion, as hotels are harder to come by, but this is our beloved neighborhood. We‚Äôll plan to host in our cozy home for parts of the weekend, so if you can find an AirBnb in our walkable neighborhood, you‚Äôll be close to the fun :)\nSolano Ave. and North Berkeley BART are convenient from here.\nFor hotels, try:\n\nThe Berkeley Marina Double Tree\nAiden by Best Western\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDowntown Berkeley\n\n\n\n\n\nDowntown Berkeley is the city‚Äôs central location for restaurants and attractions. It‚Äôs near the beautiful UC Berkeley Campus and has access to the Downtown Berkeley BART Station - 1 stop from us. This neighborhood is also quite close to our ceremony venue, the UC Berkeley Botanical Garden!\nYou‚Äôll find hotels to pick from around here, and some restaurants dear to us (Jupiter?!?)\nFor hotels, try:\n\nThe Hilton Graduate Hotel\nHotel Shattuck Plaza\nBerkeley City Club\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmeryville\n\n\n\n\n\nEmeryville is proximate to Berkeley and Oakland and is famously home to Pixar Studio‚Äôs and America‚Äôs Bike Mayor. It‚Äôs a bike- and predestrian-friendly city with access to Berkeley and Oakland. There are a few hotels with views of the Bay here!\nFor hotels, try:\n\nHyatt House Emeryville\nHyatt Place Emeryville\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Francisco\n\n\n\n\n\nThough across the bay, San Francisco is just a BART ride away (~ 25-30 minutes from Downtown Berkeley) and could be fun if you‚Äôre coming from the East Coast! If you‚Äôre hoping to get some site-seeing in, this could be for you!\nFor hotels, try:\n\nHotel Zetta\nThe Marker Hotel\n\nWe just chose these two hotels for their BART access, but we‚Äôre certain SF has loads of more beautful, comfortable hotels. Let us know if we can help you find one!\n\n\n\n\n\nOur favorites\nWhile you spend time in out beloved East Bay, why not check out some of our favorite spots?"

Quality time surrounded by the most supportive people in our lives is what we cherish most! We expect nothing more than your company on our special day.\nFor those who have asked about a registry, what would truly help us as we begin this new chapter would be contributions toward our future dreams - our honeymoon adventures and saving for our first house together.\nWe‚Äôre simply thankful to have you there to share in our joy, no matter what! üß°"
