Whether you‚Äôre just looking for lodging recommendations, or planning to stay and explore beautiful California, you‚Äôll find some of our favorite recommendations below.\nThis is just a start, but we could talk about Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco, Marin, Yosemite, Tahoe, etc. etc. etc. at great length! Feel free to reach out if you want any specific recommendations; we‚Äôll be so glad to help!"

We‚Äôll plan to host in our cozy home for parts of the weekend, so if you can find an AirBnb in our walkable neighborhood, you‚Äôll be close to the fun :)\nSolano Ave. and North Berkeley BART are convenient from here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDowntown Berkeley\n\n\n\n\n\nDowntown Berkeley is the city‚Äôs central location for restaurants and attractions. It‚Äôs near the beautiful UC Berkeley Campus and has access to the Downtown Berkeley BART Station. This neighborhood is also quite close to our ceremony venue, the UC Berkeley Botanical Garden!\nYou‚Äôll find hotels to pick from around here, and some restaurants dear to us (Jupiter?!?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmeryville\n\n\n\n\n\nEmeryville is proximate to Berkeley and Oakland and is famously home to Pixar Studio‚Äôs and America‚Äôs Bike Mayor. It‚Äôs a bike- and predestrian-friendly city with access to Berkeley and Oakland. There are a few hotels with views of the Bay here!"
