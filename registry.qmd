*After seven wonderful years of building our home together, we're so fortunate to have most of the household items we need. Please know that your presence at our celebration is **truly** the greatest gift to us. Having our loved ones from the East Coast, and from here, join us in Berkeley means everything. Quality time surrounded by the most supportive people in our lives is what we cherish most! **We expect nothing more than your company on our special day.***

*For those who have asked about a registry, what would truly help us as we begin this new chapter would be contributions toward our future dreams - our honeymoon adventures and saving for our first house together.*

***We're simply thankful to have you there to share in our joy, no matter what!*** ðŸ§¡
